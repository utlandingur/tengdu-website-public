## Competing at Silicon Vikings

On Thursday, our co-founder, Luke Hening, had the exhilarating opportunity to represent Tengdu at the 2024 Silicon Vikings Pitch Competition! The atmosphere at Kólaportíð was electric, with a buzz of energy from passionate entrepreneurs and seasoned investors.

Tengdu is a social connection platform to build and maintain a healthy, real-world social life.

## Pitching Under Pressure

Luke admits he spent the whole week feeling a mix of nervousness and excitement, meticulously practicing his pitch to ensure a clear and concise delivery within the tight 3-minute timeframe. He even aimed to get the message across in an impressive 2 minutes and 30 seconds!

"Whittling down a whole load of information into a compelling story in such a short time was a challenge," says Luke. "But with the support and feedback from my co-founder, Sesar, we refined the pitch and felt confident going on stage."

## A Message That Hit Home

While Tengdu didn't take home the top prize, Luke received a wave of positive feedback from the audience. The idea of Tengdu clearly resonated – people are craving an easier way to build a vibrant social life, like they had in their younger years.

In the words of one woman, "Yes! I _need_ this"
